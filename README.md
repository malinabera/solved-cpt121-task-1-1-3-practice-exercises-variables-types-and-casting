<strong>Task 1.1.3 Practice Exercises – Variables, types and casting </strong>

<strong><em> </em></strong>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Give appropriate declarations (type and name) for variables used to store the following values:</li>

 <li>a.An employee’s taxable salary <strong>e) </strong>The average rainfall for the past month

  <ol>

   <li>The month number within a year <strong>f)</strong> A letter to hold an answer (‘y’ or ‘n’)</li>

   <li>An employee identification number <strong>g)</strong> The constant string “Hello”</li>

   <li>The capacity of a tank in cubic inches <strong>h)</strong> The conversion rate from $AUS to $US</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Assuming that the types of the variables x, y, and z  are int, float  and double  respectively, which of the following statement(s) are likely to result in error ?</li>

 <li>                  <strong>a)</strong> x = y;              <strong>b)</strong> x = z;                <strong>c)</strong> y = x;</li>

 <li>                  <strong>d)</strong> y = z;              <strong>e)</strong> z = x;                <strong>f)</strong> z = y;</li>

 <li>The following code segment prints an incorrect result (instead of the expected result of sqr = 10000000000 ).</li>

</ol>

int num1 = 100000; int sqr = num1 * num1;

System.out.println(“sqr = ” + sqr);

Describe the problem / error that has occurred and suggest a solution or work-around to the problem which will allow the correct result to be stored and printed.
